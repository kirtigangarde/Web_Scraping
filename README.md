A **Python web scraping program** extracts product information, such as names, pricing, and ratings, from an online commerce website. Using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests`, the program fetches the webpage's HTML, parses it, and extracts the desired data. The extracted information is then stored in a structured format, such as a CSV file, making it easy to analyze or use for further processing. This process automates data collection from websites for tasks like price comparison or market analysis.
